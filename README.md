# EmotionRecognition_2D CNN LSTM networks

## Introduction
According to the nice paper,[Speech emotion recognition using deep 1D & 2D CNN LSTM networks][paper],the 2D CNN LSTM model was built by tensorflow2-keras modul.With training and testing in EmoBd, the model we built showed the closest conclusion comparead with the paper.

## Requiremrnts
The code should run the enviroment as follow list:
  name|version
  :---:|:---:
  python|3.8
  numpy|1.19.2
  tensorflow|2.2.0
  librosa|0.8.0
  scikit_learn|0.24.1

You can run the following command in the terminal to establish the enviroment : 
* `pip install -r requirement.txt`
